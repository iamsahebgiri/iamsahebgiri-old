If you work with computer(which I do most of the time) and have general people around you, it is possible that they will ask you for favour. I was no exception. I had been constantly pester for creating documents, pdf, dtp and all these stuff. And I kinda of like that but again excess of doing it make me feel sick.

Now it is during this COVID-19 pandemic, my sister had her projects to be done before deadlines.
I did most of the thing like creating documents and all these stuff. 

Like all other projects it contains same shit like acknowledgement, contents, blah blah blah! She asked me to start the page number from the chapter one and I have merged all the thing into one docs file. But I didn't know how to start the page number from diffrent page. And I was too lazy to google it.
