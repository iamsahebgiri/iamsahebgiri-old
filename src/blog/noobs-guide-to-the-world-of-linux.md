Linux had been the operating system for geeks and hacker. And it's true that there are other distribution like Ubuntu, Linuxmint, zorin os, meant for the people who want to give it a try. In this Linux 101 blog I will basically walk you through all the technical terms that you will come across while using Linux. 

It takes time to understand but it's worth while to read completely. Invest your time in it for a while.



## What do linux distributions/distro mean? 

That's the first question that you may encounter. Distribution are operating system that comes with pre installed many software that you need to run a computer. Inside every distribution there is linux. Eventually every distributions are same at its core because they are using Linux kernel. Some of the Linux distro popularly used these days are ubuntu, MX Linux, Manjaro, Debian, Kali, Parrot OS, etc. You can find whole list of all distro out there at [Distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com).


## What do desktop environment mean?

Linux is just a barebone operating system. It doesn't provide you any GUI(Graphical User Interface) meaning any pictures kind of thing. So to enable them we have desktop environments. It is package ðŸ“¦ of everything that you need from web browser to calculator. There are few of them which are used extensively by most of the Linux enthusiasts. They include gnome, KDE, etc. 

## What about Window Manager?


## What does kernel mean?

See, every system had to talk to hardware to perform certain operations. Like if you click on a mp3 file, somebody needs to send information to the speaker ðŸ”Š to play the music. Now this somebody is noone but kernel. It has the capability to talk to both hardware and software. In Linux, after bootloader( a program that run on its own when you press power button) all the responsibility is given to kernel.

## What is daemon? 

Daemon are programs that run on its own without the use of terminal.  They run in background and usually wait for some request. Like ssh server and web server. They are always active and when they recieve some request, they response back to the client. In Linux you will frequently find something.service which are daemon. They are controlled using systemctl command.
