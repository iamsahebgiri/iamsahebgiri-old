Webassembly is relatively newer concept. The main idea behind this is to provide native like performance in browser using so called mature language such as C/C++ or Rust. This is really going to change the speed of the web apps and most importantly allowing developers to build high end games, in browser. As of now, V8 supports 4GB of RAM, which means with the combination of webassembly you can build pretty much anything you dream to build in native device.
